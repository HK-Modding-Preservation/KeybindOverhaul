# KeybindOverhaul

A mod for the game Hollow Knight.

## The following edits have been made to your keybinds
- A single action can have multiple inputs assigned to it (**Cyclone Slash** has both *Up* and *Down* by default)
- Multi-key combinations can be assigned to any available action (**Dive** is *Down+A* by default)
- **Nail Arts** can be a different bind than **Nail**
- **Cyclone Slash** and **Great Slash** can be remapped and can optionally be empty (**Great Slash** is empty by default) but must be held when **Nail Arts** is released
- **VS**, **Dive**, and **Wraiths** can have unique inputs, including each quick-cast variant
- Both using and placing **Dream Gate** can be customized independently from **Dream Nail**
- **Focus** and **Cast** can be separate inputs
- **Jump**, **Nail**, **Dash**, and **Superdash** remain unchanged but are also available for customization
- The vanilla keybinds menu has been abbreviated

Your current vanilla keybinds will still take effect for menu navigation including maps, stags, shops, etc.
Keybinds set in the mod menu will not overwrite your vanilla keybind settings.
To define a multi-key combination, you can press all keys in any order, but the last key pressed must be the first key released.
Keyboard and mouse are supported, I don't know for sure about controllers.
